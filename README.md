# Christmas Treasure Hunt
In my family, the tradition of extensive and elaborate treasure hunts keeps on going on birthdays and Christmas. This year I wanted to turn the tradition a little bit more digital and decided to create a small Android treasure hunt app through Unity where a person can enter the passcodes found and track the progress in the hunt.
